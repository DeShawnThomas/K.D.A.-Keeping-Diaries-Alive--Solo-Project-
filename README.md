# K.D.A.-Keeping-Diaries-Alive--Solo-Project-

These are the files for the solo project I made for Coding Dojo! As of now it's in a V3 state post-bootcamp and fully finished and functional. Added a few tweaks. Deadlock revealed yesterday at VCT Tokyo. Will update when I have the files. 6/25/2023

## Description 
K.D.A. is an application that provides users with a unique and immersive way to document their ranked matches. Embracing a diary-style approach, this app allows users to record their gameplay experiences and insights in an organized manner.

Within K.D.A., users can seamlessly enter their ranked data, including crucial match details, while also having the ability to make comments and include YouTube links for VOD (Video on Demand) reviews. By integrating these features, the app enables users to effectively track their progress and engage in thorough self-analysis for continuous improvement.

To ensure secure access, K.D.A. employs robust measures such as Bcrypt and Python-based validations. These implementations safeguard user information and provide a secure environment for storing and managing their personal gaming data.

Whether you're a passionate Valorant player or simply seeking a dedicated platform to document and review your ranked matches, K.D.A. offers a user-friendly interface and a range of essential functionalities to support your journey towards mastery.

## Why did I make this app? 
As a passionate Valorant player, I felt the need for a more personal and immersive way to document my ranked matches. Existing platforms lacked the personal touch I craved, so I created Keeping Diaries Alive (K.D.A.).

K.D.A. is my labor of love, designed to be more than just a gameplay tracker. It's a diary-style app that allows me to capture the essence of each match, from the strategies I employed to my personal reflections. I wanted a platform where I could not only log statistics but also dive deeper into the intricacies of my gameplay.

With K.D.A., I can now record my thoughts, insights, and even include YouTube links for VOD reviews. It's like having a dedicated space for in-depth analysis and learning, all in one place.

My vision for K.D.A. is to create a companion for fellow gamers, a platform that inspires growth and engagement. I hope that K.D.A. can help players like me elevate their gameplay, capture memorable moments, and forge a deeper connection with their own journey in the competitive gaming world.
